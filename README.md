# Skeletize.js

A very simple helper for building and applying Skeleton Screens over child elements of a node for ajax loading purposes.

## Requirements

You don't need anything. This thing is pure Javascript. I'll just warn that this should only be used in modern browsers.

## Install 

```
bower install --save https://github.com/picklepilot/Skeletize.js.git
```

###### Add the default styles to your head

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="skeletize.min.css">
```

###### Add the script to your footer

```
<script src="skeletize.js"></script>
```
